## Payments Components Recipes

![recipes-logo](recipes-logo.png)

üåü Welcome to the Payments on Lightning Web Components Recipe Kit! üõçÔ∏è

We are seeing an expansion of other internal Salesforce domains wanting to integrate Payments into their applications outside of the context of commerce as well as the need for commerce partners and customer developers to extend the functionality of the out of the box Payments components. In order to support these additional use cases, we aim to develop a library of Payments Components that can be utilized by developers in different Salesforce contexts.

The main objective of this project is to provide reference payments components for partners and customer developers to use if they want to build their own custom payments LWCs. This will help reduce development time, improve the components‚Äô quality and reduce customer implementation costs.
